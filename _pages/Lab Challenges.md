## Introduction to Cisco Packet Tracer

**Description:**  
Completed introductory labs to understand the Cisco Packet Tracer simulation environment and basic networking concepts.

**Problem Statement:**  
Familiarize with Cisco Packet Tracer interface, device connections, and simple network simulations.

**Tools Used:**  
- Cisco Packet Tracer

**Approach:**  
- Navigated the Packet Tracer interface.
- Connected basic devices: routers, switches, and PCs.
- Configured IP addressing and tested connectivity with `ping`.
- Explored basic PDU simulation features.

**Lessons Learned:**  
- Cisco Packet Tracer navigation  
- Connecting and configuring basic network devices  
- Simple troubleshooting and packet flow observation

## Investigating the OSI & TCP/IP Models in Action

**Description:**  
Simulated data communication across OSI and TCP/IP layers using Cisco Packet Tracer.

**Problem Statement:**  
Visualize how data encapsulation and decapsulation happen at each network layer during transmission.

**Tools Used:**  
- Cisco Packet Tracer  
- PDU simulation

**Approach:**  
- Built a small LAN topology.  
- Sent PDUs between devices.  
- Observed encapsulation and decapsulation at each OSI layer.

**Lessons Learned:**  
- Detailed view of OSI layers  
- Protocol roles in data transmission  
- Encapsulation/decapsulation processes

## DNS in Detail (TryHackMe)

**Description:**  
Completed in-depth DNS training on TryHackMe covering the structure, function, and security considerations of DNS.

**Problem Statement:**  
Understand how DNS works, its vulnerabilities, and how attackers may exploit DNS-based weaknesses.

**Tools Used:**  
- TryHackMe labs  
- Linux tools: `nslookup`, `dig`, `whois`

**Approach:**  
- Studied DNS record types (A, AAAA, MX, CNAME, PTR).  
- Performed DNS lookups and zone transfers.  
- Analyzed DNS poisoning and spoofing techniques.

**Lessons Learned:**  
- DNS record structure and queries  
- DNS enumeration techniques  
- Security risks associated with DNS

## Web Requests (HTB Academy)

**Description:**  
Completed the Web Requests module on HTB Academy, focusing on HTTP protocols, methods, and request manipulation.

**Problem Statement:**  
Understand how web clients interact with servers, and how attackers can manipulate web requests for exploitation.

**Tools Used:**  
- HTB Academy labs  
- Browser developer tools  
- Burp Suite (for request interception)

**Approach:**  
- Explored HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).  
- Practiced crafting custom HTTP requests.  
- Intercepted requests and modified parameters to study vulnerabilities.

**Lessons Learned:**  
- HTTP protocol fundamentals  
- Intercepting and modifying web traffic  
- Understanding web-based attack vectors like parameter tampering and SSRF
